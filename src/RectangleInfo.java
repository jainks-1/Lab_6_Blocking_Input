/*Write a program that asks the user for the lengths
of the sides of a rectangle. Again, loop the input until
it is valid.

Note: Only two measures here, the Width and the Height should be doublesâ€¦
Testing: use some simple values to confirm that the calculations are correct.

Then print
- The area and perimeter of the rectangle
- The length of the diagonal (use the Pythagorean theorem)
Note: a 3.0 by 4.0 rectangle will have a diagonal of 5.0

Write a program that has the computer generate a random int value between 1 to 10 inclusive.
The program then asks the user to guess the number with a single guess.
The program displays the random number and then indicates if the users guess was high low or on the money!
Use the do while loop again to bulletproof the guess which must be an int from 1 to 10 inclusive.
